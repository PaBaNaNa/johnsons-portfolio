# Wait, Astro?

Astro, one of the rising stars of JavaScript in the Static Sites category. is a static site builder that works like an SSG but with some novel features that set it apart.

Bring several famous framework (React, Vue, Svelte, web components). While composing my website using that framework's UI components, Astro now renders a fully-static (all HTML, no JavaScript) website
Astro emphasizes fast performance with less JavaScript - and takes a partial hydration approach that allows it to load the minimal required amount of JavaScript, if and when absolutely necessary. Here's a quick overview of Astro.

## Static Site Generators

The term "static site generators" (SSG) refers to tools that automatically build static webpages for you, populating a chosen template with your custom content or data. The code generation is transparent to you, making it possible for even non-developers to setup custom static websites quickly.

Static site generation is a growing trend for fast, flexible website creation. But it requires an external service to handle hosting and build/deploy workflows. This is where Azure Static Web Apps comes in! Check out the SWA documentation for tutorials featuring popular SSGs like Hugo, Jekyll and Gatsby. We'll explore some other examples later this week.
