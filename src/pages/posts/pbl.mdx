### Project Description

Last summer, I was selected as the cometitor to represent NTUT for PBL competition, this contest were co-host by either Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese University. Unfortunately, we can go Janpan for real interaction, but I was stilling thrilled and ready for new chnallenge coming.

Before this competition, I mainly put my effort in learning the software tech, so hardware and circuit stuff is never my chalker. **Not before this**.

In this competition, there are people from Japan and native Taiwanese students, we were randomly distributed by the host. the Japanese teamates were work remotely in Japan, while in Taiwan, we work in a classroom for seven full days to design a self-propelled car which was expected to reach some goal.

It's really chnallenging for us to 'build' a car from zero to hero, especially I thought I am quite unfamiliar with **Arduino** and **C**, but I thought this is the good opportunity to build a work project in really short period.

Finally not only did my team success from a consistent trial error process, but we winning the first place of the compettion, even now when I retrospect this, it is still a sweet memory. I guess in the future, I will still dive deep into more hardware stuff, and embrace everything as a well-discipled engineer.

**_Note_**: At that time I am still not famlilar with Git, so the code was lost and there is no Repo or anythinh ohter than the picture I can share.

### My work

I was mainly resposible for the software part of the car, including connect other external equipment eg. HRSC04 for avoid obstacle, PIXY camera for object detection etc, by using provided API from Arduino IDE.

Besides, I also had to design the main C program of the car so that it can realise the logic of self-propelled car.

### What I Gained

This is really the precious chance to force me learn something in a real quick time, and do it in right way, not just 'looking good'.
