### Project Description

[Kharkiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv) is a second major city in Ukraine, while major city known as Kyiv (基輔). Our Mission is plan for the method of future reconstruction based on every Kharkiv residents' "Perfect World".

In order to create this project, our team came up with a "Collarboration" solution for residents to build their city image, this is available on both 2D & 3D.

### My work

In this project, I mainly work on 3D frontend part, this is very chanllenging for me because I have to blend Babylon with Redux so that the status can be updated globally.

My strategy was using [babylon-hook](https://github.com/brianzinn/babylonjs-hook) for connect React with Babylon. Instead of using a [components method](https://github.com/brianzinn/react-babylonjs), which I saw people using in [React Three JS combination](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)

### Built With

Since this project is aiming to be a collaboration tool, real time communication is required. In addition, state management is a huge chanllenge for how to transit between the system (backend, 2D frontend, 3D frontend etc.)

Below I listed a series of technology used in development:

- Frontend

  - React JS (A base architecture of our frontend site)
  - Redux (State management)
  - Redux Saga (Asynchronous action for exchange data between socket server)
  - Babylon JS (3D collaboration logic)
  - React Babylon hook
  - DeckGL (2D collaboration logic)
  - DeckGL react
  - Mapbox (Rendering 2D real world map layer)

- Backend

  - Colyseus JS (A websocket backend framework for real time connection)
  - Django (For file storage eg. dot geojson files and dot glb files)

- Other
  - MySQL (Store the changed Geo)
  - Docker (Mainly building a backend service containers)
  - Socket middleware
  - Typescript
  - Git
  - Jira
  - Figma (UI/UX Design Idea from design team)
  - Rendition (Convert Figma Draft to "Styled Components" in React so that we can focus working on function instead of UI styling)

### What I Gained

sumit, opensource, future
