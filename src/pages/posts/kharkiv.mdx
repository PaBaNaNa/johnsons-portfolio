### Project Description

[Kharkiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv) is a second major city in Ukraine, while major city known as Kyiv (基輔). Our Mission is plan for the method of future reconstruction based on every Kharkiv residents' "Perfect World".

In order to create this project, our team came up with a "Collarboration" solution for residents to build their city image, this is available on both 2D & 3D.

### My work

In this project, I mainly work on 3D frontend part, this is very chanllenging for me because I have to blend Babylon with Redux, also at first I was not quite familiar with front end development, so I had been nervous to slow down the team's development cycle and workflow. By the way, we were using Agile Development with Jira, like just seemed really cool for myself that I can have this chance to dive deeper in the really **Dev world** (Still me: Hello world fish!)

My strategy was using [babylon-hook](https://github.com/brianzinn/babylonjs-hook) for connect React with Babylon. Instead of using a [components method](https://github.com/brianzinn/react-babylonjs), which I saw people using in [React Three JS combination](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)

### Built With

Since the PM of my team is highly open to some new try, so I got very high flexibilty on decide my tech stack on implement the project. This project is aiming to be a collaboration tool, real time communication is required. In addition, state management is a huge chanllenge for how to transit between the system (backend, 2D frontend, 3D frontend etc.)

Below I listed a series of technology used in development:

- Frontend

  - React JS (A base architecture of our frontend site)
  - Redux (State management)
  - Redux Saga (Asynchronous action for exchange data between socket server)
  - Babylon JS (3D collaboration logic)
  - React Babylon hook
  - DeckGL (2D collaboration logic)
  - DeckGL react
  - Mapbox (Rendering 2D real world map layer)

- Backend

  - Colyseus JS (A websocket backend framework for real time connection)
  - Django (For file storage eg. dot geojson files and dot glb files)

- Other
  - MySQL (Store the changed Geo)
  - Docker (Mainly building a backend service containers)
  - Socket middleware
  - Typescript
  - Git
  - Jira
  - Figma (UI/UX Design Idea from design team)
  - Rendition (Convert Figma Draft to "Styled Components" in React so that we can focus working on function instead of UI styling)

### Closing Words

Eventually, this project was demo on the fall summit of MIT media lab summit, received highly postive feedback. It all worked it for me when I heard the news.

In the future, we will consider put this project onto open source (What an org. supposed to deal with their project in my opinion), so there will be more stuff I need to learn from dev to prodect, such as more efficient **workflow**, **testing** (I did not do in this project) etc.

I will definetely keep on learning for everything, and embrace new thing in the future.
