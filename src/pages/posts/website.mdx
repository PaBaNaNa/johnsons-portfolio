### Project Description

Recently I am really interested in web development, and would like to grind my skill via doing a personal side project. After saw serveral suggestion from the internet, I decided to give [**Next JS**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) a try, and using Github action to deploy my project.

While SEO is getting more eyes in the recent days, Next JS is getting popular today. The first impression it gave me was I can utterly write like I was writing React, but with more compatibility for the structure and utility for the structure that can be maintain easily in the future following the project get bigger.

I also noticed when I first create my project with [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) there was already a **api** folder for me to act as server, comparing to React, this is more convinient, but [some people on the net](https://dev.to/jackmellis/why-i-m-not-using-next-js-208n) might thought it kinda ruin the flexibilty we used to enjoy in the good old JS days. So I can really doing a full stack web project just wiht Next! Anyways, I think this strategy speed up my dev workflow in some degree.

In addition, in order to enhance my ability, I have give a try on [Three JS](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) (It really like the simpler Babylon JS though), and Charka UI (like MUI with more lightweight package size), also be amazbe about the power of Web Development. Not mention the Next deploy job can be easily achived by Github action hooks, which is really similat to docker-compose.yml in my opinion, very safe and convinient! In sum, this is a cool expirence for me and I will definetely grind deeper in this field later on.

**_Note_**: By the day I try to deploy this site to public, I cannot properly upload my dot GLB file, which contain the 3D onject in the picture above. The CD test always failed so it will return the loading state fowever. Finally I decided to drop it for now and open the issue on my Repo to solve this in the near future.

Finally, if you are interested below are some info of this project.
